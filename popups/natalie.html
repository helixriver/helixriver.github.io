<h1>Met Natalie</h1>
<h3>March 2006</h3>
<p>While working aboard the cruise ship Costa Marina, I met Natalie, who would become my wife three years later. We met quite literally at sea, somewhere in the middle of the Mediterranean. I was teaching English to the crew, she was the dance captain for production shows.</p>
